    where X and X' denote independent random variables drawn from the forecast

    Calculate the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) for a set of
    explicit forecast realizations.

    The CRPS compares the empirical distribution of an ensemble forecast
    to a scalar observation. Smaller scores indicate better skill.

    CRPS is defined for one-dimensional random variables with a probability
    density $p(x)$,

    .. math::
        CRPS(F, x) = \int_z (F(z) - H(z - x))^2 dz

    where $F(x) = \int_{z \leq x} p(z) dz$ is the cumulative distribution
    function (CDF) of the forecast distribution $F$ and $H(x)$ denotes the
    Heaviside step function, where $x$ is a point estimate of the true
    observation (observational error is neglected).

    This function calculates CRPS efficiently using the empirical CDF:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function

    The Numba accelerated version of this function requires time
    O(N * E * log(E)) and space O(N * E) where N is the number of observations
    and E is the size of the forecast ensemble.

    The non-Numba accelerated version much slower for large ensembles: it
    requires both time and space O(N * E ** 2).
    
    If option 'fair'is active, the estimator of the non-numba operation will be
    computed using the unbiased estimation of CRPS (aka 'Fair CRPS').

    Parameters
    ----------
    observations : float or array_like
        Observations float or array. Missing values (NaN) are given scores of
        NaN.
    forecasts : float or array_like
        Array of forecasts ensemble members, of the same shape as observations
        except for the axis along which CRPS is calculated (which should be the
        axis corresponding to the ensemble). If forecasts has the same shape as
        observations, the forecasts are treated as deterministic. Missing
        values (NaN) are ignored.
    weights : array_like, optional
        If provided, the CRPS is calculated exactly with the assigned
        probability weights to each forecast. Weights should be positive, but
        do not need to be normalized. By default, each forecast is weighted
        equally.
    issorted : bool, optional
        Optimization flag to indicate that the elements of `ensemble` are
        already sorted along `axis`.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis in forecasts and weights which corresponds to different ensemble
        members, along which to calculate CRPS.
    fair : bool, optional
        Whether to use the unbiased estimation of CRPS. 
        Default to True.
    framework : string, optional
        default to None, option is 'vectorized', which uses the 
        '_crps_ensemble_vectorized' function. Note that this is the case by
        default if numba has not been imported

    Returns
    -------
    out : np.ndarray
        CRPS for each ensemble forecast against the observations.
